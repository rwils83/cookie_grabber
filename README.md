# Cookie Grabber
## What it is
A simple flask app to log cookies sent by XSS and other fun shenanigans. 
## What it isn't
This is not going to go get the cookies for you. You have to do the work  to send the cookies
to this application. 
## What's to come
I will probably add in some docs on how to get the cookies from the vulnerable server to the application,
and maybe some instructions on how to run it. As always, any tools I put here
are for educational or approved activities. Don't use them on things you don't have
permission to use them on.
